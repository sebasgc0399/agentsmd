## How to work with AI agents

### Task format
- Start with a clear goal in one sentence.
- State exact files that can be changed.
- Include constraints (no new deps, no feature creep, deterministic output).
- Define explicit acceptance criteria before implementation starts.

### Requesting diffs and verification
- Ask for a file-by-file change summary with reasons.
- Request exact commands executed for validation.
- Ask for test output summary (passed/failed and counts).
- Require explicit mention of known risks or follow-up tasks.

### Execution protocol
1. Inspect relevant files first and summarize findings.
2. Propose the smallest safe change.
3. Implement incrementally and run tests after each meaningful step.
4. Report what changed, what was validated, and what remains.

## Expanded Definition of Done
- [ ] Scope is fully implemented with no unrelated changes.
- [ ] Output remains deterministic for same inputs.
- [ ] No placeholders leak into generated markdown.
- [ ] Error paths fail with clear messages.
- [ ] Documentation and tests are updated when behavior changes.

## Debug checklist
- Reproduce with one deterministic command.
- Capture expected vs actual behavior.
- Confirm environment assumptions (Node version, package manager, cwd).
- Check module resolution and path normalization first.
- Validate generated content length and formatting.
- Re-run minimal targeted tests before full suite.

## Testing strategy
- Prefer fast deterministic tests over broad flaky integration tests.
- Keep fixtures small and representative.
- Assert on stable output fragments, not volatile wording.
{{#has_tests}}
- Verify canonical test command: `{{commands.test}}`.
- Add regression tests for every bug fix in rendering or detection.
{{/has_tests}}
{{^has_tests}}
- If no test script exists, document manual verification steps.
{{/has_tests}}

## Do / Don't
### Do
- Do preserve existing behavior unless a change is requested.
- Do keep commits minimal and reviewable.
- Do fail fast on invalid user input.
- Do prefer explicit conditions over hidden heuristics.

### Don't
- Don't invent commands that do not exist in package scripts.
- Don't silently ignore validation errors.
- Don't mix unrelated refactors with feature work.
- Don't add dependencies unless strictly necessary.

## Agent handoff template
### Required fields
- Goal: one sentence describing expected final state.
- Scope: exact files or folders that can change.
- Constraints: what must not change.
- Validation: commands that prove the change.
- Risks: known uncertainty or follow-up items.

### Status update format
- Completed: concrete items done.
- In progress: current active step.
- Next: immediate next action.
- Blockers: missing info or external dependency.

### Review checklist
- [ ] File-level diff is easy to follow.
- [ ] Tests cover changed behavior.
- [ ] Output remains deterministic.
- [ ] No hidden behavior changes.
- [ ] Error handling is explicit.
- [ ] Documentation reflects new behavior.

### Escalation rules
- Escalate when requirements conflict.
- Escalate before adding dependencies.
- Escalate before touching unrelated modules.
- Escalate on ambiguous security implications.

## Advanced agent protocol

### Change risk matrix
- Low risk: copy updates, docs wording, isolated tests.
- Medium risk: template condition changes, validation thresholds.
- High risk: command detection logic, filesystem writes, CLI argument parsing.
- For medium/high risk, require explicit before/after examples.

### PR handoff checklist
- Include rationale for each changed file.
- Include verification commands and outcomes.
- List backward-compatibility guarantees.
- List residual risks and mitigations.

### Failure triage flow
1. Confirm failing command and exact error text.
2. Isolate if failure is detection, rendering, or validation.
3. Reproduce with fixture before touching production paths.
4. Add regression coverage before finalizing fix.

### CI hardening notes
- Keep path handling platform neutral (`path.join`, no shell assumptions).
- Keep tests independent from local machine state.
- Avoid timing-sensitive assertions.
- Keep generated artifacts reproducible across OSes.

### Verification matrix
| Layer | Check | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | Arg parsing | command output |
| Detection | scripts/framework | fixture result |
| Rendering | profile sections | markdown preview |
| Validation | limits/placeholders | unit tests |
| E2E | dry-run command | test pass |

### Rollback playbook
1. Revert profile-specific template blocks first.
2. Keep parser support only if backward compatible.
3. Re-run compact profile tests and e2e.
4. Re-introduce changes in smaller slices.

### Communication protocol
- Summarize assumptions before coding.
- Report changed files immediately after edit step.
- Report executed commands and outcomes.
- Report unresolved risks before handoff.

### Post-merge audit
- Verify README examples still run as documented.
- Verify SPEC and behavior remain aligned.
- Verify CI pass on at least one Windows runner.
- Verify default compact output remains unchanged.
- Verify standard/full remain within configured limits.

### Minimal failure report template
- Command: exact failing command
- Expected: what should happen
- Actual: what happened
- Suspected layer: detect/render/validate/cli
- Reproduction fixture: path used

### Final release gate
- Confirm profile-specific limits pass validator.
- Confirm placeholder checks remain strict.
- Confirm default compact output is unchanged.
- Confirm docs match implemented flags.
- Confirm test suite is green in CI mode.
- Confirm no unrelated files changed.
- Confirm generated markdown still starts with # AGENTS.
- Confirm profile ordering full > standard > compact.
